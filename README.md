Some explaination:
* MSA Deployer: When this tool is run, you can perform local actions or remote (through GitLab CI/CD)
* Local Action: Some actions do not request GitLab API to be performed
* GitLab API: Config file need to be fulfill to authorize access
* Gitlab CI: Use .gitlab-ci.yml in your repository. Jobs will be used to make a pipeline
* CD Jobs: Jobs will be created to be played once dependencies will be satisfied
* Clone MSA repo: Git repository with submodules will be pulled
* Docker image: a dedicated image with dependencies has to be made and will be pulled
* Launch action: actions inside the docker image will be performed
